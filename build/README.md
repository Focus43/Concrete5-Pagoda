# Building Assets Required for concrete5


## Requirements
In order to build assets for concrete5 you need:
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](http://npmjs.org/) (may be bundled with Node.js)

Once you have node.js and npm, you have to install the [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) client.
You can install it globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`. This requires that you may need to use sudo (for OS X, *nix, BSD, â€¦) or run your command shell as Administrator (for Windows).
If you don't have administrator rights, you may need to install the grunt client locally to your project using `npm install grunt-cli`.
Unfortunately, this will not put the grunt executable in your PATH, so you'll need to specify its explicit location when executing it (for OS X, *nix, BSD `node_modules/.bin/grunt`, for Windows `node_modules\.bin\grunt`).

Once you have installed the grunt client, you need to install the project dependencies: simply launch the following command: `npm install` from inside the `build` directory.

### Task parameters

Every task may have its own parameters. These parameters may be specified inline or in a file called `Gruntfile.parameters.js`.

For instance, you may execute this line of code:
`grunt taskname --nameOfTheOption=valueOfTheOption`

Or you can have a  `Gruntfile.parameters.js` like this:
```
module.exports = {
	nameOfTheOption: 'valueOfTheOption'
};
```
And you can simply launch `grunt taskname`


## Building .css files

- For debugging: `grunt css:debug`
	- The generated .css files are more readable, but they have a slightly bigger size
- For production: `grunt css:release` (or simply `grunt css`)
	-  The generated .css files are slightly smaller, but they are harder to read from a human point of view


## Building .js files

- For debugging: `grunt js:debug`
	- Building for debug will generate JavaScript SourceMap files, that greatly improve the debugging of scripts with modern browsers.
- For production: `grunt js:release` (or simply `grunt js`)
	- SourceMap files won't be generated.  


## Building everything

- For debugging: `grunt debug`
	- it's the same as calling `grunt css:debug` and `grunt js:debug`
- For production: `grunt release` (or simply `grunt`)
	- it's the same as calling `grunt css:release` and `grunt js:release`


## Debugging JavaScript with source maps

If you have installed concrete5 in a sub-directory and you want to debug JavaScript with SourceMaps, you should update the `Gruntfile.js` file, changing the following line:
`config.DIR_REL = '';`
For instance, if your concrete5 installation is at http://www.domain.com/c5subfolder, you should change it to:
`config.DIR_REL = '/c5subfolder';`


## Downloading translations from Transifex

To download translations from Transifex, and compile them in a format that can be used by concrete5 (creating .mo files), you can use the `translations` task.
You have to specify the following parameters:
- `txUsername` a valid Transifex username
- `txPassword` the password for the above Transifex account
- `txResource` the resource identifier that you want to download (for instance: `core`)
- `txLocales` a comma-separated list of locale identifiers (for instance: `de_DE,it_IT,el_GE`) that you want to download. If this option is specified in the `Gruntfile.parameters.js` file you can also write a Javascript array (for instance: `module.exports.txLocales = ['de_DE' ,'it_IT', 'el_GE'];`). If you don't specify this value then all the available locales will be fetched.
- `txProgressLimit` the task will retrieve only translations above this limit. For instance, if you specify `90`, then the task will download translations that are at least at 90% (_the default value for this option is 95%_).

Example:
```Shell
grunt translations --txUsername=myName --txPassword=myPwd --txResource=core-5621 --txLocales=de_DE,it_IT,el_GE --txProgressLimit=0
```
As stated above, some or all of these options can also be specified in the `Gruntfile.parameters.js` file (but the command-line options take the precedence).


## Remove short tags

You can use the `remove-short-tags` grunt task.
It accepts the following parameters (in `Gruntfile.parameters.js` or in command line):
- `package` The package handle you want to work on. If not specified (or if its value is `-`) the task work on the whole concrete5 directory. 
- `destination` The destination path. If not specified the source files will we overwritten.
- `shortTagRemover` A shell command that will replace short tags with long tags for a specific file. It must accept two syntaxes:
	- `command filename`: the command should overwrite the specified file
	- `command sourceFilename destinationFilename`: the command should read from `sourceFilename` and save to `destinationFilename`

If the `shortTagRemover` is not specified, the task uses a predefined PHP script (so your system should have PHP installed, minimum required version 5.3.9).

Example: `grunt remove-short-tags --package=your_package_handle --destination=../out`
